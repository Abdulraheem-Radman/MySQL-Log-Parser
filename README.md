# MySQL-Log-Parser
Streamlining MySQL Log Analysis with Python Tool

You have a MySQL logs file that you want to read, but it's large, or there were multiple users accessing the database, and you want to condense it and read it in a simplified and accurate manner, avoiding the repetition of queries.

This tool, designed in Python, can assist you by reading the file on your behalf, extracting unique queries, and creating a separate file for each user's queries. There's also an option to display only slow queries or all queries.
